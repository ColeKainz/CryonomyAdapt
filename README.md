At its core, this library provides a facade for the various cryptocurrency exchanges found online. The intent is to make
 swapping between exchanges easy. Because many of the exchanges are incredibly different from each other, we also aim to build
 a collection of exchange adapters. In addition to this, this library also provides common ways to instantiate the 
 exchanges, through various factories.
